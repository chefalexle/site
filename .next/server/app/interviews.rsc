Most of the other orders were mains which I had to make pastas for but each one also had steaks that would take time, so I knew I didn’t have to start with those yet.

First we did 60 plates and put them on trays and stored them in a fridge. We did another 60 plates, and I told him how we would wait until the servers took those plates so we could do the plates stacked below them. And by the time the servers got through those plates and the ones in the fridge, we had prepared the final 60 desserts."}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"interviews_qa__6lvKY","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"interviews_q__OS1lc","children":"7.
